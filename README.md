# 🎵 MusicAI — Discover Music Powered by AI

**MusicAI** is an intelligent web application that helps users discover songs similar to their favorites using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
Just enter any song, artist, or movie name — and let AI find the perfect tracks that match your vibe.

## 🌟 Overview

**MusicAI** is powered by **Content-Based Filtering**, a powerful recommendation approach that compares the features of songs to find the most similar ones.  
By using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**, the system analyzes relationships between tracks based on their metadata — such as title, singers, genre, and film name.

This allows users to discover songs that share a similar mood, emotion, or theme — all through an elegant and interactive web interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset contains key attributes like **Title**, **Singer**, **Composer**, **Genre**, and **Film Name**.
- Missing values are handled using `fillna('')`.
- All selected features are combined into a single **“profile text”** for each song — allowing the system to treat each track as a document of keywords.

### 2. TF-IDF Vectorization
- Each song’s text profile is transformed into numerical form using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**.
- TF-IDF gives higher weight to unique words (like specific artist or genre names) and lower weight to common ones (like “song” or “music”).
- This ensures that distinct features have greater influence in similarity computation.

### 3. Cosine Similarity
- Once every song is represented as a TF-IDF vector, **Cosine Similarity** measures how close two songs are in vector space.
- A similarity score close to **1** means the songs are highly similar in their features.
- The system then picks the top 5 most similar songs to recommend.

### 4. Content-Based Filtering
- MusicAI does not rely on user ratings or listening history.
- Instead, it focuses entirely on the **content** (metadata and textual information) of each song.
- The recommendations are generated by comparing one song’s feature vector with others — classic **Content-Based Filtering** in action.

## 🧩 Example Workflow

1. User searches for: **“Shreya Ghoshal”**
2. The app locates all songs related to the input using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
3. It computes **Cosine Similarity** scores between the input and every other track.
4. Top similar songs (based on similarity scores) are displayed instantly on the webpage.
